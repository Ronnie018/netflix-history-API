## WHY?

### this API source code was created to build a project i have in mind, which consists in a platform showing statistics and news about the users netflix favourite series, the project is far to be useful, but this API module is working fine for my purposes and i hope it can be useful for someone else too.

## what does it do?

### it receives a csv file from netflix user's page and returns all the data in a JSON file.

## routes

### POST in /myData is the only action available in this API for now - remembering that you will need to send a formdata with the csv file
