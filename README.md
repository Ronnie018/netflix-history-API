## csv-to-json Netflix history Parser

### WHY?

this API source code was created to build a project i have in mind, which consists in a platform showing statistics and news about the users netflix favourite series the project is far to be useful, but this API module is working fine for my purposes and i hope it can be useful for someone too.

### what does it do?

it receives a csv file from netflix user's page and returns all the data in a JSON file.

### routes

POST in /myData is the only action available in this API for now - remembering that you will need to send a formdata with the csv file

### how to get this csv file?

in this link you will find a tutorial, but it's not that difficult to find by yourself.
